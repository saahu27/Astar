The visuzaliztion using matplotlib is a bit slower so, to view the result, please be patient.
The map will be plotted with explored nodes
please find the images attached.

obstacle clearance : floating point numbers : 0.2
start _ node : eg : 1 1
orientation of goal node : eg:30
goal_node : eg : 9 9

for Astar old map :

clearance : 5
start_node : 5 5
radius is also a clearance : eg 5
goal node : 390 240
orientation : 0
